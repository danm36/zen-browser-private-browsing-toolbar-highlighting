# Private Browsing Toolbar Highlighting

Any Zen window in private browsing mode isn't obviously indicated by default. This theme fixes that.

## What this theme does.

By default, this theme:

* Highlights the toolbar of a private browsing window with a purple gradient.
* Adds a private browsing icon to the right of the refresh button.

It also comes with three settings:

* Replace the gradient with a solid purple color.
* Remove the background colour entirely.
* Hide the private browsing icon.

These settings can be found in the browser's preferences.
